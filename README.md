# Devin's Overhault

A lightweight modpack mostly centered around Create, with some other Vanilla-like additions. Based on Adrenaline

## Mod prefixes

I've prefixed mods in the packwiz project to make it easier to understand certain sections of the modpack:

- `con` (content) a mod that adds blocks or things that can't be easily reverted
  - **refrain from adding or suggesting these unless it's really important**
- `lib` (library) an api or library mod that doesn't add content by itself
- `opt` (optional) a mod that's optional, typically client-side, can be easily reverted
- `oth` (other) a mod that doesn't fit any of these other prefixes
- `per` (performance) a mod meant to improve game performance
